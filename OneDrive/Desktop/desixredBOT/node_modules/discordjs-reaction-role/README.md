# discordjs-reaction-role

This is a pluggable package for Discord.js applications and bots. It will add or remove a member from a specific role whenever the user reacts or unreacts to a specific message using a specific reaction.

Example use cases:

* If a member reacts with ðŸ”” to a message, the member opts in to the Announcements role to be notified of updates.
* If a member reacts with âœ… to a message, the member gets verified as human.
* Use different roles to have different clans or groups in your server.
* Have different roles such as "Likes Cats", "Likes Dogs", "Likes Ducks" and let a member add to as many roles as desired to indicate their preferences.

## Requirements

A JavaScript project already depending on Discord.js 12.

## How to use

This library exposes a single class that depends on Discord.js. It tries to be agnostic of any other framework (such as Commando). This way, it should be easy to integrate into your existing bot system.

The constructor expects to be based the Discord.js client and the configuration object. For instance,

```js
const rr = new ReactionRole(this.client, [
  { messageId: '12341234', reaction: 'ðŸ””', roleId: '5959859595' },
  { messageId: '12341234', reaction: 'âœ…', roleId: '5959859598' },
]);
```

The configuration object is an array of entries. Each entry has three keys:

* `messageId`: the ID of the message that the user has to react to.
* `reaction`: the emoji that the user has to use.
* `roleId`: the ID of the role that will be given to the user when reacted.

It is up to you how to set up the configuration object. For instance, in a small server or in a bot designed to be used with a single server, you might just hardcode the settings into the source code of your bot, although this is not recommended. You could use a SettingProvider or read it from database, download the JSON from the internet, or whatever. It is up to you.

As soon as you instantiate the ReactionRole class, `messageReactionAdd` and `messageReactionRemove` events will be caught and:

* When a member reacts using the given emoji to the given message, the member will be added to the role.
* When a member unreacts using the given emoji to the given message, the member will be removed from the role.

If you need to remove the events (for instance, to restart the settings), you can call the `teardown` method:

```ts
function stop(role: ReactionRole) {
    role.teardown();
}
```
